I am a PhD student in Political Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My research utilizes computational methods to examine the formation of political belief systems from a comparative perspective. I am particularly interested in how charismatic leadership interacts with these belief systems to insulate itself from public opinion scrutiny. My research has been published in major brazilian journals, such as *Opinião Pública* and *Revista Brasileira de Ciências Sociais*. Prior to joining UNC, I earned an MA in Political Science from UFMG (Brazil), a Specialization in AI and Data Analysis from PUC-RS (Brazil), and worked as an analyst at Instituto Ver (Brazil), focusing on public opinion and electoral polling.
